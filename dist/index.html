        <h4>Cityplace: Envisioned vs. reality</h4>
        <p>When plans for Dallasâ€™ Cityplace project were announced in the 1980s, it was one of the biggest urban redevelopments in the country. The original design had twin signature towers at the center of the project on North Central Expressway, surrounded by high-rise office and residential buildings, apartments and shopping centers. Only one of the 42-story towers in the original plan was built. Use the slider below to see the artist's rendering and the development's current form.</p>
